The “Way of Seeing” makes us think beyond an image. It makes us reflect on art and makes us realize it’s more important than just an image. It can reflect emotions or memories. One of the quotes that stood out to me the most was one in the first episode: “the camera, by making the work of art transmittable, has multiplied its possible meanings and destroyed its unique original meaning.” When John Berger goes on to explain why this is he points out that paintings are still and they can be manipulated by sound and movement. Where if the camera only captures a part of the painting and not it as a whole it changes the meaning of it. Where the camera can only capture certain details in a picture and remove the painting as a whole and take away from its original intention. This quote made me reflect on how much influence an image can have but it can also be completely different from the original painting. Often I would think having a painting on camera would represent gaining popularity where people from all around the world can be able to see it. But I didn’t realize it can actually have a negative effect since it can hurt the way the original painting was meant to be portrayed by a person. Seeing it in person is different from what it is seen through a screen. In the third episode we learn about the value of oil painting and how it is something that is worth a lot. Art itself is special and in medieval Europe oil paintings were worth a symbol of wealth. They were very detailed and each painting had different objects painted. Each painting is different and has its own value. They all record something about either someone or something.
