<p>
	In the passage "The Medium is the Massage", it is described how technology is changing and it is making us change or reshape certain aspects of our lifeâ€™s as well. Where with those changes also the things arounnd us change such as our family, neighborhood, our education, and our relations to "the others". Societies tend to be shaped by their interactions with one another rather than the content of media. Where it then explains how we are losing privacy due to new methods of technology. As well as the changes of our surrondings because of how open everything is now.
