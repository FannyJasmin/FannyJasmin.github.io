  In the readings we see this idea of technology and science being a good thing, but we also read on how they are restricted. Technology isn't completly open and available for complete acess. There are certain times where it is limited due to it being controlled by a certain company. The restriction there is when it comes to having equal quality. Even though a lot of new resources such as apps and websites are being developed, it is crucial that everyone has the liberty to have both acess to its data, and have it at the same speed as everyone.
